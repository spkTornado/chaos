Keeping the Jupyter notebooks that were used:

1. Development of another tools / workflow but might not be upto date
2. Random work

**Rules?**

1. Name of the Notebook should be descriptive enough
2. Notebook should contain a description of itself
3. Optional: If possible, provide an html/markdown version alongwith the notebook
